This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple demo to showcase how to integrate Shopify's Draggable library
with React. Currently the only portion for display is a Sortable example. More
will continually be added to cover the other parts of the Draggable library.
